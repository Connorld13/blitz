## Get Started With Blitz 

### Set Up Your Computer

You need Node.js 16 or newer. You can verify this by running `node -v` in
your terminal. If you don't have Node or need a newer version, we
recommend using a node version manager like
[fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm). That will allow you to change node
versions and even have different versions for each project.

### Install Blitz

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>

    pnpm add -g blitz
